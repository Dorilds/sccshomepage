Have an SCCS Account read on? Otherwise click [here](mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu) to create one!

What can you do with an SCCS Acount? 

Great Question! There are all sorts of possibilities. Along with an SCCS Account comes your own email! This email (unlike the ITS @swarthmore.edu email) lasts FOREVER! That's an edu email that will last!

A bit more of an oldschool service we offer is mailing lists. Create a mailing list on our [GUTS dashboard](https://guts.sccs.swarthmore.edu/dash/). Have a group or club that you want to email to remind them of upcoming events? A mailing list is for you! 

Any questions about them? Feel free to contact us.
